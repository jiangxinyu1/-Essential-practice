The	Crisis	of	College	Entrance	Exam	As	unique	method	of	selecting	talents	in	China,	College	Entrance	Examination	has	gone	through	42	years	since	restoration	of	examination	system	in	1977.	However,	new	problems	with	development	of	country	ensued.	As	for	advantages	disadvantages	of	current	College	Entrance	Examination	system,	there	are	many	different	opinions	from	all	walks	of	life.	What's	more,	some	people	advocate	canceling	College	Entrance	Examination.	Despite	this,	from	my	perspective,	it	is	absurd	to	abolish	College	Entrance	Examination	in	China,	which	not	only	solves	problem	of	talent	selection,	also	solves	problem	of	allocation	of	educational	resources	improves	knowledge	level	of	people.	Under	current	social	system	in	China,	fairness	in	selection	of	talents	is	indispensable,	which	is	also	most	important	characteristic	of	College	Entrance	Examination.	In	China,	better	result	of	College	Entrance	Examination	means	better	university,	which	means	more	possibilities	for	future.	Due	to	objectivity	impartiality	of	College	Entrance	Examination,	students	from	various	families	can	decide	their	life	trajectories.	If	College	Entrance	Examination	is	cancelled,	many	parents	will	use	their	relationships	to	help	their	children,	students	whose	parents	do	not	have	social	resources	will	have	hard	time	changing	future.	It	may	increase	gap	between	rich	poor	in	China.	In	addition,	as	far	as	Chinaâ€™s	national	condition	are	concerned,	College	Entrance	Examination	not	only	rationally	allocates	educational	resources,	also	gives	candidates	right	to	make	choices.	For	example,	in	2018,	there	were	9.75	million	college	entrance	examination	candidates,	enrollment	of	985	211	schools	was	only	450,000.	By	estimating	their	college	entrance	examination	scores,	candidates	can	submit	their	volunteers	to	colleges	with	corresponding	scores.	Regardless	of	grade,	candidates	can	choose	their	own	university	according	to	their	favorite	city	Thus,	he	College	Entrance	Examination	not	only	ensures	fairness,	also	is	effective	measure	for	quality	educational	resource	allocation	in	China.	Most	importantly,	College	Entrance	Examination	have	improved	literacy	of	Chinese	people.	First	of	all,	we	have	to	admit	that,	China	has	made	tremendous	progress	in	various	fields	from	1977.	Education	is	foundation	of	national	development,	College	Entrance	Examination	is	only	way	to	test	students	who	have	been	through	nine	years	of	compulsory	education.	It	inspires	students	to	complete	nine-year	compulsory	education	better.	Therefore,	overall	level	of	cognition	of	people	is	also	constantly	improving.	In	summary,	although	there	are	some	drawbacks	in	College	Entrance	Examination,	according	to	China's	national	conditions,	College	Entrance	Examination	is	still	most	reasonable,	fair	effective	way	to	select	talents.	Its	fairness,	distribution,	popularity	are	unreplaceable.
